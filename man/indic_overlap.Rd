\usage{
indic_overlap(
  rangeMap,
  inputOverlap,
  field = NULL,
  category = NULL,
  logger = NULL,
  spN = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rangeMap}{sf object representing a binary range map.}

\item{inputOverlap}{sf polygon or continuous raster. A feature to apply overlap.}

\item{field}{character. Name of the field to select categories/attributes.
NULL if inputOverlap is a raster.}

\item{category}{character. String with names of the categories/attributes
selected to overlap with range map. NULL if inputOverlap is a raster.}

\item{logger}{stores all notification messages to be displayed in the Log
Window of Wallace GUI. insert the logger reactive list here for running in
shiny, otherwise leave the default NULL}

\item{spN}{species name}
}
\value{
A list of 2: a polygon of the overlap and the ratio overlap statistics.
}
\description{
Overlap a binary range map with shapefile or raster
}
\details{
This function calculates the overlap between a range map and a
supplied shape or continuous raster. If the inputOverlap is a continuous raster, the
function returns a polygon of the overlap and the proportion of range:
below 25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, and 75-100%. If the inputOverlap is a polygon, the
function returns a polygon of the overlap and the percentage of the range
contained within the shape.

### Set parameters
# range map
rangeMap <- terra::rast(system.file("extdata/Bassaricyon_neblina.tif", package = "wallace"))
rangeMap[rangeMap == 0] <- NA
rangeMap <- terra::as.polygons(rangeMap)
rangeMap <- sf::st_as_sf(rangeMap)
# input overlap raster
inputRaster <- raster::raster(nrows=108, ncols=108, xmn=-80, xmx=-75)
raster::values(inputRaster)<- runif(n = (108*108))

### Run function
overlap_r <- indic_overlap(rangeMap, inputOverlap = inputRaster, field = NULL, category = NULL, logger = NULL, spN = NULL)
}
