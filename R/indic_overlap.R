#' @title indic_overlap
#' @description Overlap a binary range map with shapefile or raster
#' @details This function calculates the overlap between a range map and a
#' supplied shape or continuous raster. If the inputOverlap is a continuous raster, the
#' function returns a polygon of the overlap and the proportion of range:
#' below 25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, and 75-100%. If the inputOverlap is a polygon, the
#' function returns a polygon of the overlap and the percentage of the range
#' contained within the shape.
#' @param rangeMap sf object representing a binary range map.
#' @param inputOverlap sf polygon or continuous raster. A feature to apply overlap.
#' @param field character. Name of the field to select categories/attributes.
#' NULL if inputOverlap is a raster.
#' @param category character. String with names of the categories/attributes
#' selected to overlap with range map. NULL if inputOverlap is a raster.
#' @param logger stores all notification messages to be displayed in the Log
#'  Window of Wallace GUI. insert the logger reactive list here for running in
#'  shiny, otherwise leave the default NULL
#' @param spN species name
